## What else can be done
I did covered most of the things, but couldn't cover everything you mentioned.
Some things that can be done are - 
1. Form validations
2. Prop Type Validations
3. Use of css/inline stylings only one - for proper maintainability
4. Some animations/theme effects
5. Preview of filled form.
6. I did not use the auto complete address due to time constraint

Given more time, i can add all of them.

I didn't make any assumptions other than the data given.
