# Measurement Canada Front-End Developer Interview

## Assumptions 
 Based on the design I made an assumption that user should be able to delete and edit an existing referral.
 

## ToDo
 Due to 8 hours to time limit. I did my best to do most of the things but If more time is provided I would work on the following tasks - 
  * Completing the Referral update feature.
  * Do better form validation and handle submissions.
  * Write Tests using Jest. 

## How to Run

 ### Adding Google API Key

 
    public/index.html -> line 39 -> Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your API Key
    
 

 ``
    npm install
 ``
 
 ``
    npm start
 ``


## Interview Task

Build a Patient Referral Form using this [design spec](https://www.figma.com/file/mviScHVBuziEsW5hC5JaPr/Patient-Referral-Form-interview-Copy?node-id=0%3A1).

There is no need to build any backend (api layer, server, database). For simulating form submission, you can do a POST to /api/referrals


## Duration

Please set aside up to 8 hours to work on this challenge. We are interested in seeing how far you can get with 8 hours and therefore, completion is not the highest priority. 

Please have your submission in by <b>Sunday August 30th at midnight EST</b>.
